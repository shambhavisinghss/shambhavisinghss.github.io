As a kid I loved watching films and then introducing them to my friends after. Watching others fall in love with entertainment made me overjoyed and I knew right away, that I wanted to be involved in promoting the industry. As a high school student, I could be found in the journalism room, working on a project or social media post. As a club member, I would always find myself working on the social media team or applying for a marketing position. Being able to create engaging posts and exercise my creativity freely to help others has always been something I have loved. Outside of school, I would work on my podcast where I would uncover myths and facts about the hottest social takes and current events and collaborated with local musical artists to promote their work. Through my love for entertainment, I have learned the importance of social sensitivity, which is crucial to fair discussions concerning any topic. I believe that ASPB will help me continue to foster this passion and allow for growth. I am particularly interested in the community ASPB offers; working with creative individuals
offers a stimulating workspace that will aid in the further development of my current skil<br><br>

        Criticism is important to me because it allows me to make mistakes and then further grow and improve myself. I believe that it shows you how even executives can make mistakes. During my time as president of Amador Valley’s California Scholarship Federation chapter, I was expected to oversee all club operations as well as create lessons plans and organize volunteer events. During one of our school’s biggest events, Pigskin (the local high school rivalry football game), our club did not make as much profit as expected due to poor sales performance. I chose to sell bandanas and snacks but due to oversight, I hadn’t realized that many of the clubs has similar if not more appealing products.  My advisor had pulled me over to discuss this issue and explained that he was disappointed over the poor quality of our tabling ideas. As a president, I worked extensively with our officer team on new ideas to propagate sales. We came up with the idea sell our previous item, bandanas but with a “DIY” or “customizable” theme so students could interact with the product and have a more memorable relationship with our club. Our sales greatly increased after we executed our plan during a football tailgate fair. At our next board meeting, my advisor said that we had made up for our debt and more and he was happy with our proactivity. This was one of the many experiences that thought 
        me that crisktism is crucial to development of a team and without it, it may put an organization back a few steps. <br><br>

        I am interested in Neurosciecne as well as the arts as I have grown up around an environment that involved both.I plan to bring elements of entrepreneurship to the professional world in hope to improve societies 
        in the world to be diverse and inclusive places where people can enjoy the true experience of being a customer.
